- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

Encapsulation adds a layer of security to my codes. While programming using encapsulation, I have to pay attention on how particular data of a class will be used. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Using functions across classes that have a relationship is hard especially figuring out which way it goes. Overall, I got to do it by carefully studying the relationships. To the person who is taking this course in the future, I'd advise to make structures of the objects to better understand the relationships.
